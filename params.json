Because if\r\nyou're going to create a new tool to replace an old one, why not\r\nautomate the process of porting configuration files over.\r\n\r\nIn the future, a standard for building JavaScript files should emerge\r\nand be usable by whatever build tools exist. Maybe something like GNU\r\nMake? Ah, but that's a mere fantasy...\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nPrint out a gulp file to standard output:\r\n\r\n    grunt2gulp.js Gruntfile.js\r\n\r\nSave the generated gulp file:\r\n\r\n    grunt2gulp.js Gruntfile.js > gulpfile.js\r\n\r\n## Drawbacks, Caveats\r\n\r\nThis is a very very rough tool, you will **need** to go over the\r\ngenerated gulp file to ensure that it works and is correct.\r\n\r\nTo see the difference, run the `examples/simple-gruntfile.js` through\r\ngrunt2gulp and compare it to `examples/simple-gulpfile.js`. It got 90%\r\nof the way to a complete conversion though and it took only a bit of\r\ntweaking to get it to that state.\r\n\r\nIf there are duplicate tasks, a warning is added to the code.\r\n\r\n# How does it work?\r\n\r\nIt loads up the Gruntfile and emulates Grunt's API. When it's done\r\nlooping through all the tasks in the grunt config, it shoves them into\r\ndefinitions or tasks. Definitions are non-objects, like strings, which\r\nneed to be declared as variables when using Gulp. Tasks are converted\r\ninto Gulp tasks but some special cases have to be handled, such as\r\nKarma and Watch.\r\n\r\n## Hacking on grunt2gulp\r\n\r\nThe code is dirty because Grunt is very permissive in its input. You\r\ncan specify files in multiple ways: as a string, as a list of strings,\r\nor within a files property as a string or list. If Grunt were more\r\nmodular it would be possible to just rip out the parser that Grunt\r\nuses to turn a config into a set of tasks without also importing the\r\ntask running capability and all the other stuff.\r\n\r\nThe core functions you will want to check out are `processGruntTask`\r\nand `processGruntConfig`.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nLicensed under the MIT license.\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 Rudolf Olah <omouse@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nSee [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for full text of license.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
