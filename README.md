# grunt2gulp

Converts a Gruntfile.js to a gulp-compliant file. Why? Because if
you're going to create a new tool to replace an old one, why not
automate the process of porting configuration files over.

In the future, a standard for building JavaScript files should emerge
and be usable by whatever build tools exist. Maybe something like GNU
Make? Ah, but that's a mere fantasy...
